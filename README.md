# OSRA-screenshot-GUI
This is a PyQt5-based GUI which works with OSRA to recognize chemical structures in images.

You have to ensure OSRA was installed on your computer before using.

When you select an area on the screen, the app will save image to a dedicated directory and perform recognition. The recognized sturcture will be stored in a seperated folder as SDF file. The user can open it with ChemDraw and apply a template to the document.

For details about how to compile OSRA on MacOS, please see my [blog](https://blog.simonsun.top/sui-bi/compile-osra-on-mac/).
